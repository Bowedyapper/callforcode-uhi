did you know that there was 409 natural disasters accross the world last year? 
Every year natural disasters kill around 90 000 people and affect close to 160 million people worldwide.
We cant tell you when every disaster will strike but we can help you prepare. 
every second counts in an emergency so we simplified our app down to the essentials meaning less time trying to organise
 and more time helping those who need you.

 
with our app we allow communities to pool resources and find and provide aid to the people who need it most.

 we provide people the ability to donate supplies and their help to others in their area who are in desperate
 need in just a few minutes. 
 
 we have user interface designed to be usable by anyone in any situation
 we have a watson chat bot interface so it can still be used easily if you are injured who can help guide people to shelter and emergency responders. 
 we have a location system so we can guide emergency services to the places they are most needed in the shortest time possible
 with a ping option so if you are trapped there is a much larger chance of being found

 we have a rally point system that is regularly maintained and updated so people have a general idea where to go beforehand
an emergency locater button that sends out a signal so rescuers know where you are
