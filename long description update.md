
Did you know that there were 409 natural disasters across the world last year?
Every year natural disasters kill around 90 000 people and affect close to 160 million people                      
worldwide.

We cannot tell you when every disaster will strike but we can help you prepare as much as you can.
Every second counts in an emergency so we simplified our app down to the essentials meaning less 
time trying to organise and more time helping those who need you.

With our app we allow communities to pool resources and find and provide aid to the people who    
need it most. Food, water, and shelter are among the most essential things for everyone in times of 
disaster. We provide people the ability to donate supplies, help or a roof over someoneï¿½s head if 
they have it, to anyone in their area who is in desperate need in just a few minutes. 
We made it our priority to ensure that its just as easy to request aid because we know if you are 
asking for it then you have already been through too much.

We have user interface designed to be usable by anyone in any situation. Even with a severe injury 
we hope that we can provide a tool that might save your life. With just the press of a button you can 
request someone to assist you or offer your assistance to someone else and if you are trapped ping 
your location to emergency services or other volunteers who are waiting nearby. We do this by using 
the here API to access map and location data. This allows us to guide rescuers to the places they are 
needed most.

If you are still unable to use our UI then we have a Watson chat bot who has been programmed to 
give responses to just about any question or request you have so it can still be used easily and 
quickly and help to calm the situation you are facing.

We also have a community planning system so people who live in areas where natural disasters may 
occur can come together and plan for any situation together so that when disaster strikes people 
know what plan to follow. This will have a rally point system that is regularly maintained and 
updated so people have a general idea where to go beforehand.

If we cannot prevent natural disasters from occurring then we want everyone to know they have a 
way to get through it. The suffering caused by an event like this can be unimaginable but with our 
community app that has been built around you, you will  always have friends and people who will do 
whatever it takes to help, all they ask is you do the same.
